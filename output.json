For example, although most of his novel Foundation consists of people discussing science and politics and we find out little about his characters’ lives, Asimov wanted to convey the vast sweep of human history over centuries, and one of his points is that at such a timescale, individuals don’t matter. Thus his lack of characterization is central to this thematic aim."
